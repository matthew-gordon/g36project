          <h1 class="center-text">My New Journey Starts With Galvanize!</h1>
          <p>It was many moons ago, January I believe. I was talking with my fiancee about where I wanted to go in life, and how typically I try to go too many directions with eveything. I finally sat down on the computer and found a tutorial on building WordPress themes. I had instantly become hooked after 15 years of dabbling, on learning everything I could about coding. Fast forward 7 months, and I find myself on the door step of an intensive 24 week fully immersive program to change my life. </p>
          <p>I hope to explore the what these talnets can bring in the form of a career, I hope to join the best place that is  mutually beneficial for myself and the employer. I aspire to one day take my skills developed in the career field to launch a few start-ups that have been in the works <em>(strictly paper and my brain)</em></p>
          <p>I'm excited to join Galvanize and push myself passed the plateau I've ran into with self learning, and am ready to take a passion and turn it into my daily career. I look forward to achieving that <strong>AHA!</strong> moment that comes with figuring out difficult problems, or learning something completely new for the first time. I found it one of the most rewarding things to take an empty document, and transform it into a living, moving piece of art, and feel that thid is the most comprehensive and thrilling medium you can express yourself on. Finding inspiration and motivation working with people as excited as I am to change the path we're on, and empowering eachother to succeed with technology. </p>
          <p>Please refer to the Dnacing banana to gauge how excited I am. It is indeed, peanut butter jelly time.</p>
